An affordable, adorable, powerful hotkey device to run macros, play funny sounds, mute your microphone, change paint brush settings, or manage items in OBS! It can even have RGB or show PC stats!

While this project is public, it is not ready for any sort of prime time.

# Docs and Assets
If you are the proud owner of a new JukeBox, or are building your own, take a look at the [getting started doc](docs/getting-started.md).

Sadly, not every program is compatible with these additional function keys, and some do not allow the use of these keys. There is a running list [here](docs/program-compatibility.md) of what programs do and do not work with the keys provided by JukeBox.

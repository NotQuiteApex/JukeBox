An affordable, adorable, powerful hotkey device to run macros, play funny sounds, mute your microphone, change paint brush settings, or manage items in OBS! It can even have RGB or show PC stats!

# Docs and Assets
If you are the proud owner of a new JukeBox, or are building your own, take a look at the [getting started doc](docs/getting-started.md).

Sadly, not every program is compatible with these additional function keys, and some do not allow the use of these keys. There is a running list [here](docs/program-compatibility.md) of what programs do and do not work with the keys provided by JukeBox.

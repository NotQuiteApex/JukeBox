# JukeBox PCB
Made with KiCad 6.0.7, the PCB is the physical heart of the project. You can access the BOM [here](https://www.digikey.com/en/mylists/list/QC5ACPN0J3).

Footprint and model for USB4105-GF-A can be found [here](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/gct/usb4105-gf-a/11198441). Footprints and models for Kailh Choc's and Cherry MX's can be found [here](https://github.com/kiswitch/kiswitch).

Estimated power usage is 5 volts at 0.1 amps, or 0.5 watts.

TOFIX for V5.1: keyboard diodes are backwards, clock crystal is too tall (use one like on pico?), USB port does not extend far enough. also add community art.

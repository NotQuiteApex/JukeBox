# Program Compatibility
This file is to document what programs work with the JukeBox's F13-F24 keys. These programs were tested on Windows.

## Full Compatibility
- Discord [^discord]
- Open Broadcast Software (OBS)
- VoiceMod
- Zoom
- Minecraft
- LÖVE (love2d) [^love2d]
- Binding of Isaac: Rebirth

## No Compatibility
- Team Fortress 2
- Open Fortress
- Final Fantasy XIV
- Overwatch 2

[^discord]: Discord will only display the correct key name for F13-F19, the rest will be displayed as UNK131-UNK135. The keys still function as expected regardless of this error.
[^love2d]: LÖVE 11.x supports the full range of keys. Older versions only support a limited number of keys, such as 0.6.2 only supporting F13-F15.

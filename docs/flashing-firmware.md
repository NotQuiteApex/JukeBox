# Flashing new firmware on the JukeBox
This document is a step by step process on how to load new firmware onto your JukeBox.

## 0. Setup
If you are updating from a previous version, plug in your JukeBox and move on to step one.

If you are flashing a brand new board, you will need to put the JukeBox into flashing mode. To do so, open up the JukeBox to access the circuit board, and locate a jumper pad labeled J1. Use something metallic to bridge the jumper connection together temporarily. Plug the JukeBox into your computer. If your JukeBox appears as a storage device, move on to step two. This process may take a few tries.

## 1. Getting your device into flashing mode
With the desktop app, press the FLASH button (TODO: actually make the app do this lol). Your JukeBox will restart and appear as a storage device on your computer.

## 2. Flashing the firmware
Once your JukeBox appears as a storage device on your computer, download the latest firmware and move it onto the JukeBox storage device (TODO: have the app download the latest firmware and show it in your files with [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/66486335/13977827)). Once complete, the storage device will close, and your JukeBox will restart. You are now on the latest firmware!
